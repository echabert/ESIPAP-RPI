# ESIPAP: Edition 2023 - Module 1
#   Computings Sessions

Those computing sessions are prepared in the context of the [European School of Instrumentation in Particle and Astroparticle Physics](https://www.esi-archamps.eu/esipap-presentation/).
The agenda of the edition 2023 can be found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1226779/)


## Lecturers:
  - Eric Chabert
  - Eric Conte


## Required packages:
  - C++ compiler
  - [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)
  - [git](https://github.com/)
  - [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/)


## Environment
 
  The computing sessions are based on a setup composed of a **Raspberry Pi** 3 Model B+ and a add-on board called **Sense Hat** which contain several sensors connected to the usal peripherical equipments (keyboard, mouse and screen).
  The operating system is a **Linux** distirbution called **Raspbian**. 
  The environment, including all required packages and configuraitons has been prepared by the teachers.
  For the computing sessions, we will mainly use the **terminal** and a text editors (many are available on the system such as nedit, emacs or vim).
  In order to setup the environment in a terminal, you need to type the command:
  ``` 
  source /home/pi/tools/setup.sh
  ```
	
## Creation of github account

It will be required to create github repositories during the computing sessions.
We ask you to to it before the beginning of the sessions.
