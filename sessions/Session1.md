# Computing session 1: Acquiring data from sensors with a C++ program

This session should be done in 3 hours.
You are advised to refer the the C++ lectures and the links given below in order to
achieve the goals of this computing session.

## Goals
The subject of this first computing session is voluntarily simple in order to allow you to acquaint yourself with the environment and good practices of C++ development. During this session, you must write in C++ language a program from scratch and step-by-step. 

 During this session, we will use the Raspberry setup as a tool to monitor the environment conditions are it is often necessary during test bench or beam test while operating detector (such as silicon sensors by example).
The program to design and to implement must be able to acquire data from a sensor device and to save them into a human-readable-format file.

## Skills to develop
  - Becoming familiar with C++ development environment (compiler, linker, text editor, ...).
  - Writing a simple C++ program.
  - Using the STL classes for reading/writing a file and for displaying informations at the screen.
  - Structuring the program in functions and in different source files.
  - Using classes developed by a third party.
  - Building (compiling and linking) a project made up of several source files.
  - Improving the robustness of the code in order to prevent abnormal temrination or unexpected actions.

## Tools used
   - **Compiler**: 
       - the default compiler is **g++**
   - **Text editor**: feel free to use the editor of our choice:
       - several editors are available including emacs, gedit, nedit, vi/vim, ...

## Instructions

In order to ease the realization of this computing session, it has been decomposed into short steps.
At the end of each of them, you can compile and test our program before going further.

### Step 0: Preparing your work environment

   - Open a Terminal 
   - Load the setup file
        ```
        source setup.sh
        ```
  - Creating a folder devoted to Computing Session 1 code: 
	```
	   mkdir Session1
	   cd Session1
	```
	

### Step 1: Creating, building and running a 'Hello World!' program

   - In the folder `Session1` folder, creating a source file called `helloworld.cpp` with the following content:
     ```
       #include<iostream>
       using namespace std;

       int main()
       {
	     // Core program
	     cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
		 
		 // Return no error code
	     return 0;
       }	   
	 ```
	 
   - In order to build this program (compilation + link + creation of an executable file called `helloworld`) you need to type the command `
	     ```
		   g++ -o helloword helloworld.cpp
		 ```
   - Executing the program by issuing:
         ```./helloworld```
	  

### Step 2: Handling the SenseHat board with a C++ library and writing an acquisition program

 Technically, a C++ library called [RTIMULib](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/RTIMULib) has been developed and is installed on the setup.
 It contains several classes useful to communicate with the SenseHat elements. In order to access those functionalities, it will be required to link this library during the compilation.
 In the goal of simplifying the access to the SenseHat board, we have developed a new class called **SenseHat** which uses several classes contained in libRTIMULib.so.

#### Step 2.1: Including the class SenseHat

 Open the header of the SenseHat class in order to study and understand its structure. 
 You will find it at the address: *~/tools/sensehat/SenseHat.h*.
 Both the structure and the language keywords should have been presented during the lecture.
 If you have questions, you can directly contact the supervisors.

  - Extend the "Hello world" example by instantiating an object of the class **SenseHat** and by **initializing** it (there is method for this).
  - Save the new source file as **main.cpp**.
  - Compile the program linking the executable with the library **libSenseHat.so** and the **libRTIMULib.so**
  - "Automatize" the compilation by writing down the compilation commands in a bash script **mymake**. We will later learn how to create a **Makefile**

#### Step 2.2: First acquisition program
  By reading the header of the SenseHat class, you must identify the available methods that will be useful to achieve the tasks required below.

  - Read 10 times both the temperatures measured by the pressure and the humidity sensors every second and display them on the terminal (using ```std::cout```)
  - Make our program more configurable by asking the user the number of measurements and the delay between each measurement.
  
  Hints:
  - The delay can be generated by using a method of the class SenseHat (it is defined in the mother class called *SenseHatCore*). It uses the UNIX command sleep which use delay expressed in microseconds.
  - Use ```std::cin``` to retrieve parameters entered by the user.

### Step 3: Exporting measurements

It is often useful to disentangle the acquisition program from the data analysis one. The goal of the acquisition program FirstDAQExport.cpp to be written is to store data in a given numerical format. 
For the sake of simplicity, we will store the data in a CSV (Comma Separated Value) format. 
This imply that variables of a given measurement (once per line) are separated by a comma.

  - Write a first version of the program that store in a CSV file the following values:
     - the time in microseconds since the first measurement
     - the pressure [bar]
     - the relativity humidity
     - the temperature measured by the pressure sensor [◦C]
     – the temperature measured by the humidity sensor [◦C]
     – both temperatures from the CPU and GPU of the Raspberry Pi [◦C]
  - Protect the code against unavailable measurement by adding a default value (-9999), allowing a offline treatment
  - Modify the program to write this functionnality as a function which takes as arguments the number of measurements and the delay.
  - Split the project in 3 files: a file CSVExport.h and CSVExport.cpp which contain respectively the prototype and the implementation of the function as well as a main program main.cpp which call the function.
  - Write the compilation instructions in a script **mymake** and compile the project.
  - Test if the program is working properly. The integrity of the CSV file can even be tested by loading it with **OpenOffice Cal** (hint: change the delimeter for CSV file in the configuration to use "," and not ";").

 ### Step 4: Measurement campaigns

 Measurements in various conditions can be done, allowing dedicated analyzes in the next computing sessions. 
 In order to facilitate the execution of several runs with various conditions, modify the main program to read from the command line the delay, the number of measurements and the output CSV filename. ```Ex: ./main 0.25 10 myoutput.csv```

 A list of measurements is proposed on the table below. It would be interested for analysis purpose. Take de delay of 1 sec by default.

 |Name | Duration [min] | Comments |
 | :--- | :---: | :--- |
 | Stable conditions | 5 | |
 | High rate    | 0.25 | scan short delay [ms or micros] | 
 | Humidity     | 3    | blow on the SenseHat board after 30'|
 | Temperature  | 3    | run an air dryer after 30' |
 | Activity - 1 | 4    | run *hot.py* |
 | Activity - 2 | 4    | launch *video.avi* |
 | Activity - 3 | 4    | run *hot.py* - SenseHat on top of RPI |
 | Activity - 4 | 4    | launch *video.avi* - SenseHat on top of RPI |
 | Outside      | 6    | move the setup from inside to outside |


### Step 5 (optional): Display measures with the LED matrix

The Sense Hat board is equiped with a LED matrix. It is possibe to change the color of each
of the individual pixels via methods of the class SenseHat. 
Functionnalities are available on the SenseHat class but remain basics.
In the next session, it will be proposed to develop a class to write sentences and numbers with the LED matrix.
Meanwhile, in this section, you are free to use the LED matrix to display visual information playing directly with the individual pixels.
Here is a list of possible small projects:
 - represent the value of the measured observables (temperature, humidity) on a 8 LED line (you could use 2 different lines).
 - use the range 0-64 pixels to reprensent the intensitiy of the temperature or humidity.
 - use the y-axis to represent the intensity while the x-axis is used to represent the time: evolution of the temperature or humidity vs time.
 - make the LED blinking if the measurement is above it a predefined threshold.
 - ...
