# Checking the setup on Windows system


## Step 1: Checking git

 ### 1.1. Testing the git command
 
  - Launching the console (Command Prompt) application. To do that, make the touch combination `WINDOWS+R` and then type `cmd.exe` in dialog box.
  - Typing the command line `git --version`
  - If git is properly installed on your system, the previous command should display the version of the git package.

 ### 1.2. Cloning a public repository
 
For testing that git manages to access GitHub from the internet, we propose you to clone a public repository which will be useful in the following.
 
  - Launching the console (Command Prompt) application.
  - Creating a work folder. For instance<br/> 
```cd C:\```<br/>
```mkdir WORKDIR```<br/>
```cd WORKDIR```<br/>
  - Type the command line `git clone https://github.com/echabert/ESIPAPCpp.git`
  - If git works properly, a folder called `ESIPAPCpp` must appear on your disk.
